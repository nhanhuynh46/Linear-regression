## Exercise with R:
* Start R on the lab computers.
* Load the 'faraway' data package into R.
* Read the 'pima' data into R.
* Summarize the 'pima' data. Spot variables that contain 0. These will need to be set to 'missing'.
* Display the sorted BMI variable. 
* Set 0 values to NA for the BMI variable.
* Re-sort the BMI data to confirm that values of zeroes have been removed.
* Set 0 to NA for the glucose variable.
* Create a histogram of the BMI variable.
* Create a scatterplot of BMI vs. glucose.
